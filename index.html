            <h3 class="rainbow">FAQ:</h3>
            <p>Q: Who are you?</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: I'm Brian, nice to meet you.</p>
            <p>Q: How old are you?</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: That's quite the mystery, isn't it?</p>
            <p>Q: Why is your text rainbow?</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: Because the rainbow text looked cool but I couldn't fit it in anywhere else in the website.</p>
            <p>Q: Where do you live?</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: Again quite the mystery! I'll tell you this, somewhere in North America.</p>
            <p>Q: Are you that guy from r/pan? Or r/sequence?</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: As I said earlier, you'll find me scattered across the internet ;)</p>
            <p>Q: Let's talk about about music production. What do you use to make your music?</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: I use FL Studio, stock and free plugins. I don't currently have any audio interfaces or anything like that, just me and my computer. My family does, however, have a nice big Yamaha digital piano, and I have a MIDI to USB cable for that, so I can tippity tap play piano to my computer.</p>
            <p>Q: Alright, how's your computer? What's your setup?</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: For my computer, I have a 2012 MacBook Pro, upgraded to 8gb of RAM and an SSD. While I'd like to upgrade it, that costs money, something I just can't seem to find enough of! Although, whenever I do, I'm definitely going to build my own PC and use Linux.</p>
            <p>Q: What about your headphones?</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: Good question, I have Monospace 8323s. They're only about 16 dollars so they're super cheap, however they're great headphones. I highly recommend them.</p>
            <p>Q: Okay, what about programming? You said you did that, right?</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: I guess I did! I mainly program in Java, with IntelliJ. I made some Minecraft plugins and I'm actively developing for my Minecraft server, <a href="https://discord.me/thefloatingcity">The Floating City</a>, which you should check out by the way. For general programmy type text editing, I use VSCodium.</p>
            <p>Q: What about instruments? You said you played those.</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: I did, yes. I'm currently learning piano, and the music theory that goes with it. I also play the glockenspiel, or xylophone for the person who doesn't like that word. My sister has a ukulele and I play with that a bit sometimes too. I'd also like to take drum lessons sometime.</p>
            <p>Q: You said you're learning music theory! What's your favorite chord?</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: It definitely has to be Cmaj7add246.</p>
            <p>Q: Languages! Do you speak them?</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: I speak English and I'm learning Spanish!</p>
            <p>Q: I want to throw my money at you!</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: I have a Patreon, you can see the link up above!</p>
            <p>Q: Why did you have the above question? Literally no one wants to give you money.</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: I know I'm sorry, that might've been me asking the questions there :(</p>
            <p>Q: I want to ask you a question! It's not listed here!</p>
            <p class="rainbow">A: If you have a question, contact me through Discord, I'll try my best to answer it, and maybe put it here!</p>

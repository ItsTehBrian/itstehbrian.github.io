            You'll find me scattered across the internet. If you see me, feel free to say hi!

        <h2 class="rainbow">FAQ:</h2>

        <p>Q: Who are you?</p>
        <p class="faded">A: I'm Brian, nice to meet you.</p>

        <p>Q: How old are you?</p>
        <p class="faded">A: That's quite the mystery, isn't it?</p>

        <p>Q: What are your favorite colors?</p>
        <p class="faded">
            A: My favorite colors are blue, gray, and orange, in that order.
            Any shade of blue, any shade of gray, and any shade of orange. They all really compliment eachother.
        </p>

        <p>Q: Where do you live?</p>
        <p class="faded">A: Again quite the mystery! I'll tell you this, somewhere in North America.</p>

        <p>Q: Are you that guy from r/pan? Or r/sequence?</p>
        <p class="faded">A: As I said earlier, you'll find me scattered across the internet ;)</p>

        <p>Q: Let's talk about about music production. What do you use to make your music?</p>
        <p class="faded">
            A: I use FL Studio, stock and free plugins. I don't currently have any audio interfaces
            or anything like that, just me and my computer. My family does, however, have a nice big Yamaha
            digital piano, and I have a MIDI to USB cable for that, so I can tippity tap play piano to my computer.
        </p>

        <p>Q: Alright, how's your computer? What's your setup? </p>
        <p class="faded">
            A: For my computer, I have a 2012 MacBook Pro, upgraded to 8gb of RAM and an SSD.
            While I'd like to upgrade it, that costs money, something I just can't seem to find enough of!
            Although, whenever I do, I'm definitely going to build my own PC and use Linux with AMD hardware.
        </p>

        <p>Q: What about your headphones?</p>
        <p class="faded">
            A: Good question, I have Monospace 8323s. They're only about 16 dollars so they're super cheap,
            however they're great headphones. I highly recommend them.
        </p>

        <p>Q: Okay, what about programming? You said you did that, right?</p>
        <p class="faded">
            A: I guess I did! I mainly program in Java, with IntelliJ.
            I made some Minecraft plugins and I'm actively developing for my Minecraft server,
            <a href="https://thefloating.city">The Floating City</a>, which you should check out by the way.
            For general programmy type text editing, I use VSCodium.
        </p>

        <p>Q: What about instruments? You said you played those.</p>
        <p class="faded">
            A: I did, yes. I'm currently learning piano, and the music theory that goes with it.
            I also play the glockenspiel, or xylophone for the person who doesn't like that word.
            My sister has a ukulele and I play with that a bit sometimes too.
            I'd also like to take drum lessons sometime.
        </p>

        <p>Q: So, you play instruments. Do you make music?</p>
        <p class="faded">
            A: Yeah sure you can check out my Soundcloud or my Bandcamp.
        </p>

        <p>Q: Languages! Do you speak them?</p>
        <p class="faded">A: I speak English and I'm learning Spanish!</p>

        <p>Q: I want to throw my money at you!</p>
        <p class="faded">A: I have a Patreon, you can see the link up above!</p>

        <p>Q: Why do you have the question above? Literally no one wants to give you money.</p>
        <p class="faded">A: I know, yeah, that might've been me asking the questions there, sorry :(</p>

        <p>Q: I want to ask you a question! It's not listed here!</p>
        <p class="faded">
            A: If you have a question, contact me through Discord.
            I'll try my best to answer it and maybe put it here!

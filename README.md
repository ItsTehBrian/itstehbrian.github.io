# Hi there, I'm Brian!
This is my website, it's pretty fancy! I know it's not much, but it's a starting point for what's hopefully soon to come.

## To-do:
Rigorously go over main.scss and index.html.
Change the color of links.
Text could be smaller, more condensed.
Make the website more responsive and better looking across all devices.
Add a header/navbar, put the theme toggler there.
Possibly change the theme switcher to an actual button.
Possibly remove gradient on all text, only leave it for headers.
Possibly split up about me, contact, and FAQ, into separate pages.

### Thing that I might need later:
<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll@15/dist/smooth-scroll.polyfills.min.js'>script>
<script>var scroll = new SmoothScroll("a[href*='#']', {header: '#topnav', easing: 'easeOutQuad'}");</script>

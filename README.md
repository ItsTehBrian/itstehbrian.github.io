TehBrian's Website
=

Hello. I'm Brian. This is a personal website for me to test and learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Please don't take it seriously. This is a side project.

Since this is just a personal website, I will be keeping the to-do list and the issues tracker here in the README, rather than relying on github. It doesn't need to be that complicated.

TO-DO
-

Add a navigation bar.

Add a portfolio.

Add a favicon.

Remove js at end of each file.

ISSUES
-

None.

TehBrian's Website
=

Hey there. I'm Brian. This is a personal website for me to test out my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript kung fu skills. Take none of it seriously. This is all for practice and tests.

Since this is just a personal website, I will be keeping the to-do list and the issues tracker here in the README, rather than relying on github. It doesn't need to be that complicated.

TO-DO
-

Make the website not as bad. It's pretty bad right now.

Add some *aNiMaTiOnS* wow fancy.

Possibly add a portfolio with some work I've done? Not like I've done anything important.

ISSUES
-

None except the website looks like absolute GARBAGE.

TehBrian's Website
=

Hey there. I'm Brian. This is a personal website for me to test out my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
Please don't take it seriously. It's all as a side project.

Since this is just a personal website, I will be keeping the to-do list and the issues tracker here in the README, rather than relying on github. It doesn't need to be that complicated.

TO-DO
-

Add a navigation bar.

Possibly add a portfolio.

Possibly add a link to my youtube channel.

ISSUES
-

None.

            <h1>About TB Inc.</h1>
            <p>
                <b>TB Inc.</b> short for <b>TehBrian Incorporated</b>, is a good and ethical, for the people, privately owned and privately operated company.
                Rather than operating everything under one name, it owns <i>districts</i>, which is not a seperate entity, but a slice of the company.
                The districts are as follows:
            </p>
                    
            <br>
                    
            <p>
                <b>TB News</b>, which is a news source that is a 2x2 map that anyone can put anywhere in their land. It is free, automatically updating and
                extremely trustworthy as only I can edit it. It will feature general news, corporate news, and basically anything there is to know new
                about the world. Additionally, for a weekly fee, corporations, players, and any other entities can request for advertisements or 
                propaganda as long as it is true and not malicious.
            </p>
                    
            <p>
                <b>TB Labs</b>, which is a laboratory that <b>TB Inc.</b> uses to test, research, and develop new products, such as new filters and pumps for <b>TB Aqua</b>,
                new standards that could be added to <b>TB Standards</b>, or new security devices for <b>TB Security</b>. 
                Previously public, due to other corporations closely spying us, we have decided to make it private with the promise that we're not holding 
                anything malicious, and in due time everything in there will be released. However! You can request that 
                <b>TB Inc.</b> research a specific thing for your company and with a small fee we will be happy to do so!
            </p>
                    
            <p>
                <b>TB Aqua</b>, which is a consumer and corporate complete solution to all water needs! Filters, pumps, water softeners, water filtration systems,
                no-leak waterslides, custom fish tanks, air bubblers, and more! Plus custom installation for all of the above. 
                If it involves water, we've got you covered!
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>TB Security</b>, is a consumer and corporate solution to some security needs. Although not complete like some other companies, such as lacking bots
                or drones, road security, scanners, and the like, it does have some interesting new developments and technologies such as
                the new patented <b>PassLockâ„¢</b> technology! If you need good password security, we have the tech! We'll be expanding on this district soon!
            </p>
                    
            <p>
                <b>TB Standards</b>, which is a guideline that all of <b>TB Inc.</b> holds itself up to, including roads, design, security, water purity,
                environmental standards, sanitation, upkeep, and more! It is an exceptional set of standards that makes sure anything relating to
                <b>TB Inc.</b> is of the upmost quality and you can be assured you're getting a good product. All companies are not expected to follow
                these guidelines however if they would like to be certified, they can contact us and we'll do a thorough inspection!
            </p>
                    
            <br>
                    
            <p>
                However, <b>TB Inc.</b> is named after the owner, <i>TehBrian</i>, and for good reason! The company does not employ any employees or staff members!
                No individual people or personnel are employed, paid by, or expected to work for <b>TB Inc.</b> except for the owner, <i>TehBrian</i>!
                To keep everything relating to <b>TB Inc.</b> the utmost of quality, everything is overseen and done by me. 
                However, not all work can be done alone! So for some help, enter <i>partnerships</i>.
            </p>
                    
            <p>
                Partnerships are an official, non-contractual alliance between <b>TB Inc.</b> and another trusted company. These two companies
                share resources, labor, and knowledge! If one task is too great for one company alone, they can rely on each other to provide
                advice, and with some benefit or profit, or maybe just good will, resources and labor.
            </p>
                    
            <p>
                Additionally, things specific to the company can also be shared! Again, this is non-contractual, nothing is obligated, this works
                exactly like a friendship. You wouldn't expect your friend to hand over his car but you can rely on him to buy you a drink if you had
                a rough day. And you wouldn't expect your friend to tell you every single thing about themselves but they have no problems opening
                up if they just had a break up or just got a new job promotion. And you would probably be one of the first to know!
            </p>
                    
            <p>
                Again, these are non-contractual and just an alliance between the two companies, so they can be dropped like a hot potato at anytime
                if the companies are on not so great terms anymore. Currently, <b>TB Inc.</b> is partnered with <b>BlackCon</b> and <b>Chisel Enterprises</b>!
            </p>
                    
            <br>
                    
            <p>
                Hopefully you've learnt something about <b>TB Inc.</b>! While this is a company to make <i>some</i> money, we're not trying to squeeze
                every penny wherever we can. I hope that we can make enough money to be sustainable, but also make the rest of the world a better
                place and SimCity a better place to live in. We hope you choose <b>TB Inc.</b> for whatever it is you need! Whether that be research, or
                a complete water solution, we hope we'll be the first to come in your mind. Thanks!
            </p>
